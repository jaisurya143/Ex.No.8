## Aim 
To explore and understand how different prompting techniques 
influence AI models in generating and manipulating audio content. 
This experiment aims to develop skills in crafting effective 
audiospecific prompts, evaluate the quality and relevance of 
AIgenerated audio outputs, and critically analyze model behaviors 
across various audio generation tasks. Ultimately, it fosters 
practical knowledge for creative and ethical use of AI-driven audio 
technologies
## Song title:O Surya
## Text:
Rising high in crimson fire,
Breaker of the darkest hour,
Golden chariot in the sky,
Eyes of truth that never lie.
Chorus
O Surya, flame of might,
Shine your blaze on day and night,
Guide our hearts, and clear our sight,
With your rays of fearless light.
Verse 2
Through the storms and through the haze,
You burn steady, never sways.
Time itself bows at your pace,
You’re the soul of every face.
Bridge
O rider of the endless dawn,
With seven steeds you carry on,
Hope reborn with every ray,
Burn the shadows far away.
Final Chorus
O Surya, flame of might,
Armor bright in every fight,
Ride the skies in endless flight,
Surya Deva, source of light.

## Conclusion 
This experiment has demonstrated the significant 
potential and challenges of leveraging prompt engineering for AIdriven audio generation. By exploring various prompt types—such 
as zero-shot, few-shot, descriptive, and directive prompts—
participants gained insight into how subtle changes in prompt 
wording can drastically influence the quality, style, and relevance of 
the generated audio outputs. Comparing multiple advanced models 
like AudioLM, Bark, and MusicGen illuminated each system’s 
unique strengths and limitations, highlighting the importance of 
selecting the right tool for specific audio tasks
